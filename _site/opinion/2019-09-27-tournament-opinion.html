    <p>It seems to me we may be missing a number of potential participants because of the way we are organising the chess league.</p>

<p>Three of the chess clubs I have attended in this area in the last eight years have had membership divided in their vision of the purpose of a chess club. There are those who see the overriding aim to be to have a social evening with perhaps a couple of half hour games. There are other clubs where rated three hour games in  friendly surroundings are seen as the main aim. The two alternative targets have not always been seen as comfortably compatible.</p>

<p>I am aware of clubs where the social evening with a few friendly games is the prime target where some of the more competitively minded membership has left the club feeling frustrated. I am also aware of clubs where members have been put off because they have been repeatedy paired against much stronger players in tournaments. The problem of mismatched pairings has become much greater since most surviving chess clubs became smaller, and team sizes have dropped (e.g. from eight players in a team to four players in a team)</p>

<p>I believe there are clubless chess players in the Marches who would like to join a team where they will be able to play competitive chess and possibly maintain their ECF grading. I know there are chess clubs where the majority don’t want to play chess games which would be recognised as standard by the ECF or WCU.</p>

<p>As far as the ‘Marches Chess League’ is concerned it is mistaken to think all the players are going to come from existing chess clubs. I am aware of several players who have left chess clubs because the club no longer met their needs, and other clubs which have collapsed partly because of a lack of consensus about whether the club should enter a particular tournament.</p>

<p>I think the Marches Chess Leage is more likely to get more teams if it makes it clear from the outset that individual players can register and be helped to come together to form a team. It is a mistake to think of getting the captain before the team. It is much more likely to suceed if the players chose captains between themselves.</p>

<p>Getting in touch with chess players who are disaffected ex club members is going to be a slow and difficult job. It cannot be done within the timeframe you have set. There is also an issue with contacting competition minded individual members of clubs which have not chosen to participate.</p>

<p>I am continuing to work on the website in the hope you will try again to get teams by helping individual players who may or may not belong to a chess club come together and form a team (and then select a captain).</p>
